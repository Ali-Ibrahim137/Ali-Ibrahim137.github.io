# A - Not
Just print $$1-x$$.

Time complexity $$O(1)$$.

[Code](https://github.com/Ali-Ibrahim137/Competitive-Programming/blob/master/AtCoder/abc178/a.cpp)

# B - Product Max
Always $$x$$ should be equal to either $$a$$ or $$b$$. Same thing for $$y$$ it should be equal to either $$c$$ or $$d$$.

Time complexity $$O(1)$$.

[Code](https://github.com/Ali-Ibrahim137/Competitive-Programming/blob/master/AtCoder/abc178/b.cpp)

# C - Ubiquity
## dp solution
As the value of $$n$$ is small, we can use `dp` to solve the problem, let `dp[i][f0][f9]` be the number of arrays of length $$i$$, $$f_0$$ determine if their exist some $$j < i$$ such that $$a_j = 0$$. Same thing for $$f_9$$. The transactions are simple, from `dp[i][f0][f1]` we can go to `dp[i + 1][f0][f9]` of `dp[i + 1][1][f9]` or `dp[i + 1][f0][1]`.

Time complexity $$O(n)$$.

## inclusion exclusion principle
We can find out that the solution is:
$$ans = 10^n -2 * 9^n + 8^n$$.

Time complexity $$O(log(n))$$.

[Code](https://github.com/Ali-Ibrahim137/Competitive-Programming/blob/master/AtCoder/abc178/c_inclusion_exclusion.cpp)

# D - Redistribution
## Combinatorics solution
Using stars and bars theorem we know that the number of ways to chose $$k$$ positive integer numbers that sum up to $$n$$ can be found using: $${n + k - 1}\choose{k - 1}$$. Let's try to use this to solve the problem.

We can write that:

$$ a_1 + a_2 + \dots + a_k = n$$

But $$a_i \ge 3 $$, so we can write $$ b_i = a_i + 3.$$

$$ b_1 + b_2 + \dots + b_k = n - 3 \times k$$.

Now to solve the problem we just need to iterate over all $$k$$ such that $$ 3 \times k \le n$$ and add to the answer $${n - 2\times k - 1}\choose{k - 1}$$

Time complexity $$O(n)$$.

[Code](https://github.com/Ali-Ibrahim137/Competitive-Programming/blob/master/AtCoder/abc178/d_Combinatorics.cpp)

## Formula
If you try some small values you can find out that the solution follows a formula, more precisely:
`dp[i] = dp[i-1] + dp[i-3]` and `dp[3] = 1`, `dp[i] = 0` for $$i \le 2$$.

Time complexity $$O(n)$$.

Bonus: can you solve the problem in $$O(log(n))$$?

# E - Dist Max
The Manhattan distance between tow points $$A(x_a, y_a)$$ and $$B(x_b, y_b)$$ can be written as:
$$dis = \lvert x_a - x_b \rvert  + \lvert y_a - y_b \rvert$$
This can be one of the four cases:

$$(x_a - x_b) + (y_a - y_b)$$

$$(x_a - x_b) + (-y_a + y_b)$$

$$(-x_a + x_b) + (y_a - y_b)$$

$$(-x_a + x_b) + (y_a + y_b)$$

Let's consider the first case:
$$(x_a - x_b) + (y_a - y_b) = (x_a + y_a) + (-x_b - y_b)$$

When we iterate over all points we can find that part of the solution comes from the point $$A$$ the other part comes from other point, so if we just consider the first case then the Maximum Manhattan distance is $$(x_a + y_a ) + max((-x_b - y_b)) $$ for any point $$B \ne A$$.

To find the max value we use 4 `multiset` for `x + y`, `x - y`, `-x + y` and `-x -y`. First we add all the points to our multisets, then for every point $$i$$ we query our multisets to find the better solution.

Time complexity $$O(n \times log(n))$$.

# F - Contrast
The problem has no solution if there is some number $$x$$ that $$cnt[x] > n$$ for all $$x$$ in $$a, b$$. The proof is simple, because there are just $$n$$ indexes to fill.

Let's reverse array $$b$$, then the indexes where $$a_i = b_i$$ will form a contentious segment between $$[l, r]$$, also these values will be equal. So we just need to change these values with other values out of the range.

Time complexity $$O(n)$$.
